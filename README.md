# SolidWorks_License_Auto-Deactivator
A background task/service that monitors for SolidWorks to shut down, then automatically disables the license; This allows a standalone license to be used elsewhere, effectively replicating a networked license. Be adviced that there may be a limit to the total activations per license (reportedly 999), but this can be raised.
